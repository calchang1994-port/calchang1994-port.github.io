# Portfolio (Static)

A minimal, **icon-free** portfolio site with a light/dark theme toggle and two featured projects.

## Projects Included
- **Task Manager (MERN)** — Live: https://task-manager-calchang1994.netlify.app • API: https://task-manager-api-g0uk.onrender.com • Repo: `https://github.com/calchang1994/task-manager` (update if different)
- **To‑Do List (React)** — Live: https://calchang1994.github.io/todo-react/ • Repo: https://github.com/calchang1994/todo-react

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a repo for the site (or use `calchang1994/calchang1994` for your profile site).
2. Put these files at the repo **root** so `index.html` is in `/`.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch** → `main` → `/ (root)`.

## Deploy (Netlify)
- **Build command:** (none — static)
- **Publish directory:** `/` (the repo root)

## Customize
- Update project **Repo** links if your URLs differ.
- Replace demo links if you deploy to Netlify instead of GitHub Pages.
